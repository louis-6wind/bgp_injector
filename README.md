# bgp_injector
Simple BGP route injection tool. It can be used in a lab environment to inject BGP Link-State prefixes.

This is a simple python tool to inject a high number of BGP routes onto a lab routing environment. 

Do not use this on your live network!

To use this tool just edit the config file named bgp_injector.cfg. 
The configuration is very simple but get in touch if you need help.
